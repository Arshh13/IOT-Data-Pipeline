# NYC Taxi ide CO2 Emissions Analysis

This project analyzes the environmental impact of NYC taxi rides by calculating CO2 emissions based on trip distance and passenger count. It also visualizes the emissions trends and suggests ways to reduce carbon emissions.

## Features:
- Calculates fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for each taxi ride.
- Compares CO2 emissions for different passenger groups (1-2 vs 3+).
- Provides actionable insights for reducing emissions.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyc-taxi-emissions.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python taxi_emissions_analysis.py`

## Example:
After running the script, you will see a plot comparing the CO2 emissions per day for small vs large passenger groups.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Status:
Project is complete. Future work could involve adding real-time data integration.
